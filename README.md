# Console 'Flappy bird'-like game 

It was developed as a homework assignment for the university in 2021.

Currently works for Windows only.

## Requirements

- Python >3.6
- Windows (Tested only on 10 and 11)
- The ability to run scripts in the terminal

## Adjust parameters

Set `UPDATE_TIME` to your value to change screen update time. The lower the value, the faster the game is updated

Use `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` to control the size of the playing field

Use `DBS` variable to set the distance between columns. (Default = 12)

You can change game appearance to with 
`DEFAULT_SYMBOL` - symbol of empty space
`COLUMN_SYMBOL` - columns symbol
`PLAYER_SYMBOL` - symbol of player (Something that flies between the columns, trying not to touch them, and it definitely doesn't look like a bird)

## Disclaimer

Have fun and do what you want.
