## Requirements

- Python >3.6
- Windows (tested only on 10 and 11)
- The ability to run scripts in the terminal

## Adjust the parameters

Set `UPDATE_TIME` to your value to change screen update time. The lower the value, the faster the game is updated

Use `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` to control the size of the playing field

Use `DBS` variable to set the distance between columns. (Default = 12)

You can change game appearance to with:
- `DEFAULT_SYMBOL` - symbol of empty space
- `COLUMN_SYMBOL` - column symbol
- `PLAYER_SYMBOL` - symbol of player (something that flies between the columns, trying not to touch them, and it definitely doesn't look like a bird)

## Disclaimer

Have fun and do what you want!
